The central ledger is a series of services that facilitate clearing and settlement of transfers between DFSPs, including the following functions:

- Brokering real-time messaging for funds clearing
- Maintaining net positions for a deferred net settlement
- Propagating scheme-level and off-transfer fees

The following documentation represents the services, APIs and endpoints responsible for various ledger functions.

## Deployment

See the [Onboarding guide](Onboarding.md) for running the service locally.

## Configuration

### Environment variables
The Central Ledger has many options that can be configured through environment variables.

| Environment variable | Description | Example values |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| CLEDG\_DATABASE_URI   | The connection string for the database the central ledger will use. Postgres is currently the only supported database. | postgres://\<username>:\<password>@localhost:5432/central_ledger |
| CLEDG\_PORT | The port the API server will run on. | 3000 |
| CLEDG\_ADMIN_PORT | The port the Admin server will run on. | 3001 |
| CLEDG\_HOSTNAME | The URI that will be used to create and validate links to resources on the central ledger.  | http://central-ledger |
| CLEDG\_ENABLE\_BASIC_AUTH | Flag to enable basic auth protection on endpoints that require authorization. Username and password would be the account name and password. | false |
| CLEDG\_ENABLE\_TOKEN_AUTH | Flag to enable token protection on endpoints that require authorization. To create a token, reference the [API documentation](API.md). | false |
| CLEDG\_LEDGER\_ACCOUNT_NAME | Name of the account setup to receive fees owed to the central ledger. If the account doesn't exist, it will be created on start up. | LedgerName |
| CLEDG\_LEDGER\_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD | Password of the account setup to receive fees owed to the central ledger.  | LedgerPassword |
| CLEDG\_ADMIN_KEY | Key used for admin access to endpoints that require validation. | AdminKey |
| CLEDG\_ADMIN_SECRET | Secret used for admin access to endpoints that require validation. Secret also used to sign JWTs used for Admin API. | AdminSecret |
| CLEDG\_TOKEN_EXPIRATION | Time in milliseconds for Admin API tokens to expire. | 3600000 |
| CLEDG\_EXPIRES_TIMEOUT | Time in milliseconds to determine how often transfer expiration process runs. | 5000 |
| CLEDG\_AMOUNT__PRECISION | Numeric value used to determine precision recorded for transfer amounts on this ledger. | 10 |
| CLEDG\_AMOUNT__SCALE | Numeric value used to determine scale recorded for transfer amounts on this ledger. | 2 |


## API

For endpoint documentation, see the [API documentation](API.md).

For help preparing and executing transfers, see the [Transfer Guide](TransferGuide.md)

## Logging

Logs are sent to standard output by default.

## Tests

Tests include unit, functional, and integration. 

Running the tests:


    npm run test:all


Tests include code coverage via istanbul. See the test/ folder for testing scripts.
