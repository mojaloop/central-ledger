#  1. <a name='Prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

If you have followed the [general onboarding guide](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop/blob/master/onboarding.md#mojaloop-onboarding), you should already have the following cli tools installed:

* `brew` (macOS), [todo: windows package manager]
* `curl`, `wget`
* `docker` + `docker-compose`
* `node`, `npm` and (optionally) `nvm`

In addition to the above cli tools, you will need to install the following to build and run the `central-ledger`:

<!-- Commented out until there is content in this section
###  1.1. <a name='macOS'></a>macOS
```bash
#none - you have everything you need!
```

###  1.2. <a name='Linux'></a>Linux

[todo]

###  1.3. <a name='Windows'></a>Windows

##  2. <a name='InstallingandBuilding'></a>Installing and Building

Firstly, clone your fork of the `central-ledger` onto your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/central-ledger.git
```

Then `cd` into the directory and install the node modules:
```bash
cd central-ledger
npm install
```

> If you run into problems running `npm install`, make sure to check out the [Common Errors/FAQs](#CommonErrorsFAQs) below.

##  3. <a name='RunningLocally'></a>Running Locally (dependencies inside of docker)

In this method, we will run all of the core dependencies (`kafka`, `mysql` and `mockserver`) inside of docker containers, while running the `central-ledger` server on your local machine.

> Alternatively, you can run the `central-ledger` inside of `docker-compose` with the rest of the dependencies to make the setup a little easier: [Running Inside Docker](#RunningInsideDocker).

### 3.1 Run all back-end dependencies as part of the Docker Compose

> Note: You can remove the `objstore` from the below command if you disable MongoDB (`MONGODB.DISABLED=true` is disabled in the `./config/default.json` or set environment var `export CLEDG_MONGODB__DISABLED=true`).
> Note: mockserver below is optional. Include it if you require its use.

```bash
# start all back-end dependencies in Docker
docker-compose up -d mysql kafka temp_curl objstore simulator mockserver ml-api-adapter
```

This will do the following:
* `docker pull` down any dependencies defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, and the services (mysql, kafka, etc) specified in the above command
* run all of the containers together
* ensure that all dependencies (i.e. mysql, kafka) have started for each services.

### 3.2 Configure the DB environment variable and run the server

> Note: Ensure that the `sidecar` has been disabled (`SIDECAR.DISABLED=true` is disabled in the `./config/default.json`) or set environment var `export CLEDG_SIDECAR__DISABLED=true`).
> Note: If you do disable Mongodb (i.e. `CLEDG_MONGODB__DISABLED=true`), please ensure that you comment out the following line `sh /opt/wait-for/wait-for-objstore.sh` from the following file: `docker/wait-for/wait-for-central-ledger.sh`.

```bash
# disable SIDECAR in config/default.json temporary by setting 
# "SIDECAR": { "DISABLED": "true", ...

# Disable the SIDECAR (required)
export CLEDG_SIDECAR__DISABLED=true

# Disable the MongoDB (optional)
export CLEDG_MONGODB__DISABLED=true

# set the CLEDG_DATABASE_URI* environment variable (required):
export CLEDG_DATABASE_URI=mysql://central_ledger:password@localhost:3306/central_ledger

# start the server
npm run start
```

Upon running `npm run start`, your output should look similar to:

```bash
> @mojaloop/ml-api-adapter@4.4.1 start /fullpath/to/ml-api-adapter
> run-p start:api


> @mojaloop/ml-api-adapter@4.4.1 start:api /fullpath/to/ml-api-adapter
> node src/api/index.js

```

### 3.3 Follow logs of the back-end dependencies
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```


##  4. <a name='RunningInsideDocker'></a>Running Inside Docker

We use `docker-compose` to manage and run the `central-ledger` along with its dependencies with one command.

### 4.1 Run Central-Ledger and all dependencies as part of the Docker Compose
```bash
# start all services in Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

This will do the following:
* `docker pull` down any dependencies defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file
* `docker build` the `central-ledger` image based on the `Dockerfile` defined in this repo
* run all of the containers together
* ensure that all dependencies (i.e. mysql, kafka) have started for each services.

### 4.2 Follow the logs
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```


## 5. Handy Docker Compose Tips

You can run `docker-compose` in 'detached' mode as follows:

```bash
npm run docker:up -- -d
```

And then attach to the logs with:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

When you're done, don't forget to stop your containers however:
```bash
npm run docker:stop
```

If you need to clean up everything in your docker environment:
```bash
# Bring stop and remove all containers and volumes
docker-compose down -v 
```

## 6. (Optional) Connecting MySQLWorkbench to MySQL inside Docker

If you installed MySQLWorkbench from the [general onboarding guide](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop/blob/master/onboarding.md#5-mysqlworkbench-optional), follow these instructions to get MySQLWorkbench connected to the `mysql` container running in docker.

Please follow the below instructions:

1. Click the add (+) icon

4. If successful, you will see the following dialogue:
    * click "OK" to dismiss the dialogue
    * click "OK" once more to confirm the database connection

    <img src="images/MySQL_Help_4.png" width="400">

5. This should now be shown on you MySQLWorkbench dashboard
    * click on the connection to open the database

    <img src="images/MySQL_Help_5.png" width="400">

6. In the top left, click the **schema** tab > and expand **central_ledger** section
    * You should see the `central_ledger` database underneath
    * if you haven't yet started your server, no tables will be present, but they will be populated when you start your server

    <img src="images/MySQL_Help_6.png" width="400">


##  7. <a name='Testing'></a>Testing

We use `npm` scripts as a common entrypoint for running the tests.

> Note: Ensure that you stop all Docker services (`docker-compose stop`) prior to running the below commands.

```bash
# unit tests:
npm run test:unit

# check test coverage
npm run test:coverage

# integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

  ```  

### 9.4 Docker-Compose Issues

#### 9.4.1 On Linux, ML-API-Adapter is unable to retrieve the callback end-points from Central-Ledger

Shutdown all docker images, and modify the following project configuration: `docker/ml-api-adapter/default.json`
```json
{
  "PORT": 3000,
  "HOSTNAME": "http://ml-api-adapter",
  "ENDPOINT_SOURCE_URL": "http://host.docker.internal:3001",
  "ENDPOINT_HEALTH_URL": "http://host.docker.internal:3001/health",
  ...
```

Replace `host.docker.internal` with `172.17.0.1` as per the following example:

```json
{
  "PORT": 3000,
  "HOSTNAME": "http://ml-api-adapter",
  "ENDPOINT_SOURCE_URL": "http://172.17.0.1:3001",
  "ENDPOINT_HEALTH_URL": "http://172.17.0.1:3001/health",
  ...
```

> Note: This will ensure that ml-api-adapter can send requests to the host machine. Refer to the following issue for more information or if the above ip-address is not working for you: https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/264.

Restart all docker images.

#### 9.4.2 When running all services, central-ledger is unable to connect to MongoDB on startup

If you do disable Mongodb (i.e. `CLEDG_MONGODB__DISABLED=true`), please ensure that you comment out the following line `sh /opt/wait-for/wait-for-objstore.sh` from the following file: `docker/wait-for/wait-for-central-ledger.sh`.
Alternatively make sure that it is uncommented if you do NOT wish to disable the object store.
