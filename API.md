# Central Ledger API
***

The central ledger has two APIs targeted at different consumers. The DFSP API is used by DFSPs to prepare and execute transfers, and for DFSPs to retrieve their current settlement position. The Admin API is used by the operational hub to manage DFSPs and ensure the health of the system.

## Data Structures

### Transfer Object

A transfer represents money being moved between two DFSP accounts at the central ledger.

The transfer must specify an execution_condition, in which case it executes automatically when presented with the fulfilment for the condition. (Assuming the transfer has not expired or been canceled first.) Currently, the central ledger only supports the condition type of [PREIMAGE-SHA-256](https://interledger.org/five-bells-condition/spec.html#rfc.section.4.1) and a max fulfilment length of 65535. 

Some fields are Read-only, meaning they are set by the API and cannot be modified by clients. A transfer object can have the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| id   | URI | Resource identifier |
| ledger | URI | The ledger where the transfer will take place |
| debits | Array | Funds that go into the transfer |
| debits[].account | URI | Account holding the funds |
| debits[].amount | String | Amount as decimal |
| debits[].invoice | URI | *Optional* Unique invoice URI |
| debits[].memo | Object | *Optional* Additional information related to the debit |
| debits[].authorized | Boolean | *Optional* Indicates whether the debit has been authorized by the required account holder |
| debits[].rejected | Boolean | *Optional* Indicates whether debit has been rejected by account holder |
| debits[].rejection_message | String | *Optional* Reason the debit was rejected |
| credits | Array | Funds that come out of the transfer |
| credits[].account | URI | Account receiving the funds |
| credits[].amount | String | Amount as decimal |
| credits[].invoice | URI | *Optional* Unique invoice URI |
| credits[].memo | Object | *Optional* Additional information related to the credit |
| credits[].authorized | Boolean | *Optional* Indicates whether the credit has been authorized by the required account holder |
| credits[].rejected | Boolean | *Optional* Indicates whether credit has been rejected by account holder |
| credits[].rejection_message | String | *Optional* Reason the credit was rejected |
| execution_condition | String | The condition for executing the transfer | 
| expires_at | DateTime | Time when the transfer expires. If the transfer has not executed by this time, the transfer is canceled. |

| isActive | Boolean | *Optional* Users may be disabled/enabled |
| createdDate | DateTime | *Optional, Read-only* Time when account was created |

### Notification Object
